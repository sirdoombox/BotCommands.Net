# BotCommands.Net
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/qhg0wre804mn2fvi?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sirdoombox/botcommands-net) [![NuGet version](https://badge.fury.io/nu/BotCommands.Net.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/nu/BotCommands.Net)
## What?
A service and library agnostic way to define commands for your bot, it also provides parsing and execution so all you have to do is implement the functionality.

## Why?
Depending on which service you're making a bot for, the library for that service may or may not have a built-in commands system, and learning an entirely new commands API for each different platform you might not be something you want to do. With this library all platforms are easily supported.

## How?
Check out the [Getting Started](https://github.com/sirdoombox/BotCommands.Net/wiki/Getting-Started) page on the wiki for a quick rundown.
A very simple example can be found [here](https://github.com/sirdoombox/BotCommands.Net/tree/develop/BotCommands.Net.Example)

## Dependencies
