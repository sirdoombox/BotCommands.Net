# BotCommands.Net

## What?
A service and library agnostic way to define commands for your bot, it also provides parsing and execution so all you have to do is implement the functionality.

## Why?
Depending on which service you're making a bot for, the library for that service may or may not have a built-in commands system, and learning an entirely new commands API for each different platform you might not be something you want to do. With this library all platforms are easily supported.

## How?
Grab this project from NuGet (coming soon), Create a Context, Create a Command, Pipe your input into the Commander instance and you're good to go.
A very simple example can be found [here](https://github.com/sirdoombox/BotCommands.Net/tree/develop/BotCommands.Net.Example)

## Dependencies
Currently this project has no additional 3rd party dependencies and it targets .NET Standard 2.0 meaning that you can use this in NetCore and NetFramework apps.
